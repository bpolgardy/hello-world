Getting to know GitHub

Hi there! My name is Ben and these are my first steps in GitHub. I'm fairly new to programming and currently I'm doing an online web-development course with CodeBerry. That's why I've registered here. I've also just started learning Danish as I'm thinking about moving to Denmark. I also speak German, English and Hungarian. I've lived in Germany, Hungary, the UK and in the US. I'm married with four kids: Kira, Lara, Leo and Erik.
